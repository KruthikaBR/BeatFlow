# BeatFlow
## Design Choices
### Typography
We used the 'Open Sans' font from Google Fonts for its readability and clean design. It's a humanist sans serif typeface that's optimized for print, web, and mobile interfaces.

### Color Scheme
We used a simple color scheme with a light background and dark text for readability. The color of the buttons was chosen to be vibrant to attract user attention.

### Layout
The pricing plans are displayed in a grid layout, which is responsive and adjusts according to the screen size. This makes the page look organized and easy to navigate.


## Features
### Pricing Plans
The page displays different pricing plans with their features and prices. This allows users to compare the plans and choose the one that suits their needs.
Interactive Elements: The page includes interactive elements like buttons. 
Responsive Design: The page is designed to be responsive, offering a seamless experience across various devices and screen sizes.

## Challenges Encountered
### Responsiveness Ensuring that the page looks good on all screen sizes was a challenge. We used a responsive grid layout and media queries to overcome this challenge.
